Redirection Tool

  The Redirection Tool can be used for storing references to moved content to enable redirects,
  or it can be used for giving objects multiple URLs (aliases). If a page is not found, the tool looks
  at its list of redirects to see if there is a match, and if so, it redirects to that page.

  The Redirection Tool is released under the GPL licence.

  Future plans include a more intelligent 404 handling, where the tool would either 
  search for alternative pages based on the components of the requested URL and 
  automatically redirect if there is only one hit, otherwise display a limited
  number of hits, or alternatively chop off URL components until it finds an
  object that can be published to the user.
